# Working with AtomicUI

AtomicPane is the base class for all UI elements. Visible states are managed via UIStateManager.

UI template instances are meant to be stored under `ReplicatedStorage.GuiTemplates`, or can be instantiated in the assets folder. There is an included snippet `/amodule` that can be used to create new UI asset modules.

See [the API page](/api/AtomicPane) for more technical and usage details.
